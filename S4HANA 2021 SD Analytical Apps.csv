The app shows you whether the percentage of confirmed sales orders has increased or decreased.  The app tile displays the percentage of confirmed sales orders for the last 3 weeks. You can drill-down by plant and material, for example.  You can branch to the material and sales order object pages.    Sales Order Items - Backorders With this tile, you can identify backlogs or bottlenecks regarding your customer's requested quantity and delivery date. This allows you to see where you can increase future sales volume and customer satisfaction, for example, by collaborating with your team to transfer order confirmations from a C customer to an A customer. Backorders are orders that cannot be confirmed due to a lack of product availability, for example, if order items are partially confirmed or not confirmed for the requested delivery date.  The app shows you whether the number of backorders has increased or decreased, and whether business is going well with the right customers. For example, is it going well with C customers, and your A customers are being neglected? If so, you can transfer order confirmations from C to A customers.  You can drill-down by plant and material, for example.  You can branch to the material and sales order object pages. You can use the associated Sales Order Fulfillment app to resolve unconfirmed quantities, and delivery and credit blocks.   Sales Orders - Demand FulfillmentWith this tile, you can identify bottlenecks that hinder you in fulfilling your customer's requirements, by not delivering their goods by or before the requested delivery date.

One central attribute is Cost in document currency in the Billing Document Item (I_BillingDocumentItem) query.The following are some examples of possible sales processes:1. Sell-from-StockIn this case, the cost is usually taken from a condition, which is filled from the material valuation segment in the product master or, in the case of billing, the goods issue. 2. Third-Party In this case, the cost is usually taken from a condition, which is filled from the material valuation segment in the product master or, in the case of billing, the invoice receipt.3. Intercompany In this case, the cost is usually taken from a condition record of an intercompany price.    Net Amount    Note The key figures are calculated based on items that are part of business objects, for example, invoice items in customer invoices, or credit memo items in credit memos. However, this can also be mixed, for example, credit memo items can be part of invoices, but still contribute to the Credit Memo key figure.",SBRT_APPSS1,/sap/bc/ui5_ui5/sap/sbrt_appss1,k1478774521404,,,https://fioriappslibrary.hana.ondemand.com/sap/fix/externalViewer/?appId=F5310
